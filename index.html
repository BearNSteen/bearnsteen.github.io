        <h1>Welcome to Monduli.github.io!</h1>
        <div id="intro">Hi there! My name is Dan Glendon. I've been programming for years, but I've only really recently become what I would consider a "software professional". I had dabbled in various languages, making small Python programs as a kid, and I won Lua programming competitions in the online game Roblox in 2007, before it became a global phenomenon like it is today. In fact, one time I won the same competition two times under two separate aliases!</div>
        <div id="intro">Straight out of high school, I went for obtaining my first degree in Criminal Justice. I enjoyed the subject matter, as there wasn't a "Law" major at the college I attended, but in the end, I didn't really want to become a police officer or a corrections officer (because I really wanted to study law, not police history!). So I came back to school in order to earn my second Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, which is what I'm really passionate about. I have a respect for my studies of law, and I realize it partially made me the person I am today, but I would rather work with computers instead of criminals directly.</div>
        <a class="nav-link" aria-current="page" href="/projects" id="plink">Here are my projects!</a>
