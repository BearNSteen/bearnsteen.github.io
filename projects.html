        <div id="writing">This is a purposely incomplete Encyclopedia on plants and watering. There was no possible way that I would make an actual complete encyclopedia in 2 weeks, but this is a reasonable version of a larger idea. Currently, it only contains plants that grow in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and even at that, it is only more common perennials. Regardless, this project is more an exploration of what PyQT can do, as I had never used it before.</div>

      <div id="writing">This is a pet project of mine that I started ages ago. It is a visual novel, which is a type of video game that plays out like a book with images. You can generally see the people who are speaking on the screen while you play, making it a sort of interactive book. This also includes combat with something of a rogue-like system (random elements, random enemies, random loot), but the main focus is on the story and the writing. I used Python to create:</div> 
      <div id="writing">Real-time features - the game tracks if a day has progressed since you last opened it, and adjusts who you can talk to in the Cafe accordingly.</div>
      <div id="writing">Saving and Loading - necessary elements of a game to maintain your progress. Uses the Python "pickle" module.</div>
      <div id="writing">Statistics for Character Development - uses classes and functions to make a class based system for combat (Paladin, Warlock, etc) and keeps track of statistics useful in battles</div>
