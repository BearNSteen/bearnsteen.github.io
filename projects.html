      <a class="nav-link" aria-current="page" href="/projects" id="plink">Plant Encyclopedia</a>
      <div>This is a purposely incomplete Encyclopedia on plants and watering. There was no possible way that I would make an actual complete encyclopedia in 2 weeks, but this is a reasonable version of a larger idea. Currently, it only contains plants that grow in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and even at that, it is only more common perennials. Regardless, this project is more an exploration of what PyQT can do, as I had never used it before.</div>

      <div>On the main menu, you have the following buttons: Browse Flowers: Click to open the Encyclopedia interface, where you can click on the flower of your choice and peruse information about it. Random Flowers: Opens the Encyclopedia interface, but with a random flower selected. Intended for those who like to learn. Watering: Opens the watering interface, more on this below. Exit: Closes the application.</div>
        
      <div>On the browse interface, you can expect to see a list of flowers on the left side of the window and a large space on the right side, along with the buttons "Add to Watering", "Remove from Watering", and "Back". Upon clicking a flower, an HTML page with information about the flower will open and enrich your life with descriptions of flowers, as would be expected. If you click the "Add to Watering" button, the flower you choose will be added to the Watering interface (again, more on that below) and the "Remove from Watering" does the opposite. Back will return you to the main menu.</div>
        
      <div>On the watering interface, you will see a planterbox visual with the flowers added using the browse interface with exclamation marks indicating that they need to be watered. To the right is a list of all the flowers and when the next time is that you need to water them. The tools to add and remove flowers are located in the browse interface.</div>
